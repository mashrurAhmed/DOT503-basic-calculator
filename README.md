# DOT503-basic-calculator

A simple calculator app. 
It asks for input in the format x + y. 
x and y are any number with an operator (+, -, *, /) between them. The spaces are mandatory.
You may use the result of your previous calculation by typing the letter 'r' instead of a number.
You can exit the program anytime by typing the letter 'N'.

To build the project, simply type in the command "pyb -v".
The '-v' tag describes verbose results such that if the build fails, the reasons are clearly displayed.
